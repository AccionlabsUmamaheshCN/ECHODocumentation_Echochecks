      An eCheck, or electronic check, is a digital version of a paper check that
      is used to make a payment online.    

      With an eCheck, money is electronically withdrawn from the Payor’s
      checking account. Money is transferred over the ACH (Automated Clearing House) network and
      deposited into the Payee’s checking account.
